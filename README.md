Planning to make an app with spotify and random genre apis, which will pick a random genre for you and then pick songs related to it (potentially with direct links or downloads). Can maybe have profiles or something to track which genres you've had, and which songs you have looked at potentially. Should only randomly pick a new genre when the user presses a button. It must then include a simple login system (With just username as no password) + sign up.
